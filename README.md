The goal is to predict the duration of medical sick leaves based on data of previous leaves.

Each row of data is one previous leave of one worker, and includes:

    - Age of the worker 
    - Time that the worker has been in the company
    - Sex of the worker
    - Indicator of whether the sick leave is a relapse
    - Number of sick leaves that the worker has had up to the moment of being sick 
    - Number of individual leaves that the worker has been until the moment of being on leave 
    - CNAE (activity category) of the company in which that worker works 
    - Worker group of tax contribution 
    - Type of contract of the worker
    - Type of disease that the doctor has diagnosed according to ICD9 categorization
    - Size of the company in which the worker works 
    - Total number of accumulated sick leaves that the company has 
    - Day of the week on which the leave occurred 
    - Week of the year in which the leave occurred 
    - Month of the year in which the leave occurred 
    - Postal code of the person who is on leave
    - Weather the person is working on several jobs
